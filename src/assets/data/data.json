		"category": "management",
		"description": "At scale, stuff breaks. There are more cross functional and go-to-market teams needed for launches, more dependencies, communication and collaboration become more difficult and it causes a strain on product teams and the company as launch dates are missed. At Intercom lived through this pain as we tried to launch new products and failed – until we introduced program management. The perception was that this would slow us down and add an extra layer of unnecessary management. But done well program management enables teams to do their jobs well, better, by acting as the glue that ties everyone together – product, go-to-market and leadership teams – and a driving force for delivering company strategy."

		"description": "Nick worked on projects as an engineer, a designer, and sometimes even both. As an engineer, when Nick has given wireframes to work off of, he first works on breaking down the problem into smaller chunks of work and tackles them one at a time. As a designer, he imagines an end-product and then tries to build components in Sketch until he can develop the experience he's visualizing. Engineers tend to work bottom-up while designers tend to work top-down, and this can lead to a lot of frustration when collaborating. Here're some things designers can do to make collaborating with engineers smoother"

Within the one day #PoDojo Lean Innovation Dojo we provide a micro-version of the toolchain that we are using in our daily practice as coaches of venture and organizational sponsored start-up teams. The day will begin with learning how to identify and model the customer jobs as possible opportunities for innovation. Next, we will practice several ideation techniques finding solutions that fit customer needs and that work within business models. And finally, we will learn how to test our ideas using a rich set of methods to validate hypotheses derived from conceptual models."

The emphasis is shifting onto how best to use it as an invisible enabler of physical and sensory experiences, and how to create the conditions to enable and deliver new experiences to the end users."

In this workshop, participants will be invited to take part in a super sprinted version of the Double-W process, a remote lean branding service developed by With Company, and understand how constant designer-client communication, a framework-based methodology and a thorough end-to-end process are the ingredients to develop a carefully co-created brand, which is encompassed by a bespoke brand strategy and can even influence all aspects of a company, from communication down to product strategy."

The current trend towards design systems feeds into this logic, abstracting a highly reusable presentational layer. Design is Atomic; code is neatly separated into presentational and container components. But what happens when these different paradigms meet in the middle? Should the app architecture be influenced by Atomic principles? How do we represent state changes in the design system?"

The problem was that with 50 apps we had 50 different approaches to how to build a frontend application. We needed to scale our development processes, so in late 2017 we embarked on Tangerine - a program to standardise principles that define a world class frontend application as it scales up, and apply this to Jira."

These tools are great for setting timers, adding reminders, and playing a song. But compared to the sheer amount of information and interaction available to us on the web, they can still feel quite limited.

Modern CSS gives us a comprehensive set of tools that lets us embrace the fluidity of the web."
